currently need to manually copy out some resources from the apk, and you also need to preprocess some of them

this is an example of how an ANDROID_APP_DATA_DIR will look after doing this, but before the apps start using
their data dirs to store e.g shared preferences

you should export ANDROID_APP_DATA_DIR=<path to this dir> when launching an apk from the test_apks folder

CAVEAT: the preprocessing is only guaranteed to be done properly on files which are ever used when running
the app under the translation layer; some files could have been missed if the app ran just fine and didn't
complain about them
